I'm a professional software developer specialized in **information system engineering** based in Heidelberg, Germany.  

My primary focus lies on designing useful **data models** and robust **system architectures** with simple **deployment solutions**, chosing the best **databases** for the tasks, and building lightweight and secure **web APIs** for mobile and web clients.   

As a freelancer I've helped clients building their products by creating **React** and **Android** applications with **Javascript**, **ClojureScript** and **Kotlin**, by building server systems in **Node.js**, **Java**, and **Clojure** with databases like **Mysql**, **Redis**, **Datomic** and **CouchDB**, and by maintaining their systems using **Linux** and **Docker**.   

I'm also co-author of [replikativ](http://replikativ.io), an open, scalable and distributive infrastructure.
